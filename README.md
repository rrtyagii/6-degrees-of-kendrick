# About

Kendrick Lamar is one of the best to ever to do it, if not the best. 

With his huge network, there's an enormous library of artists just a stone's throw away from Kendrick. But how short is that stone's throw? Search for an artist and find out for yourself!

This website gets its name from the theory of 'Six Degrees of Separation' in which every pair of people on the planet are on average just six connections away from one another.
